# DataLoader
Output YAML data anywhere in WordPress.

Download and install from the ZIP file. Then move the `yaml` folder to `wp-content/uploads`, and add the following shortcode to any post or page:
```
[dataloader file="blogroll.yml" tpl="blogroll.php"]
```

Play around with the `yaml` folder's contents and adjust your shortcode(s) accordingly. (Protect your YAML and PHP template files as you see fit.)
